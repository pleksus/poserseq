# Poserseq

Poserseq is a transpose sequencer for the Allen Synthesis Europi Eurorack module.

Poserseq takes a clock and a cv signal as inputs and outputs six transposed versions of the sequence.

The sequences modify the input cv by half steps. Up to two octaves positive or negative.

Each sequencer channel has a clock divider and clocked sample and hold option.
